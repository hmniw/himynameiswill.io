It seems so dumb, because this website is so simple, 
but I've lost track of the hours I've sunk into putting 
it together.
I can pin most of the blame for the time sink on deciding midway 
through to completely change the design, and I am nothing if not a 
stickler for a great design, so naturally, most of my time has been
spent fiddling with CSS.

Anyways, I've put this website together using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and it's
actually been a lot of fun. There's an excellent tutorial video
on Pluralsight by [Marcelo Pastorino](https://twitter.com/evangeloper?lang=en)
that helped me put almost the entire functionality of the site together,
with most of the design influenced by a great theme I saw for Hugo
called [Codex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-codex/).

It's actually been a really useful exercise in learning a bit more
about React, and although I'm not a pro by any means, it's certainly
going to help me better understand the code base of the project I'm 
currently staffed on, and will undoubtedly continue to useful in the
future.

There's still a bunch more work I've yet to do to make it responsive
and beautiful on mobile devices, and to improve accessibility, but
on the whole I'm super excited to see this coming together, and I'm
looking forward to continuing to work on it.
